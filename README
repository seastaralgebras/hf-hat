**********************************
First of all, you need to install Sage. (Visit http://www.sagemath.org/)

The main program is hf-hat.sage. Two Heegaard diagrams for
Sigma(2,3,7), and a single Heegaard diagram for Sigma(2,3,4) are
stored in the files Sigma_2_3_7.sage, Sigma_2_3_7_other.sage, and
Sigma_2_3_4.sage. See the files for instructions on how to input a
Heegaard diagram.

Copy any of those files to a new file foo.sage. Modify foo.sage to
input your Heegard diagram.

Start sage on the terminal. Then load foo.sage.
