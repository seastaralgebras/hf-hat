**********************************
First of all, you need to install Sage. (Visit http://www.sagemath.org/)

The main program is hf-hat.sage. Some Heegaard diagrams are stored in
the file heegaard_diagrams.sage.  See the files for instructions on
how to input a Heegaard diagram.

Add your Heegaard diagram to file heegaard_diagrams.sage. (Feel free
to comment out the older Heegaard diagrams.)

Start sage on the terminal. Then load heegaard_diagrams.sage.
