**********************************
First of all, you need to install Sage. (Visit http://www.sagemath.org/)

The main program is hf-hat.sage. Some detailed examples are worked out
in example.sage. See the files, particularly the file example.sage,
for further instructions.

Copy the example.sage file to some file foo.sage. Add your Heegaard
diagram to the file foo.sage. (Feel free to delete the older Heegaard
diagrams.)

Start sage. (On the Bash terminal on my GNU+Linux system, typing sage
works.) Then load foo.sage. (If you load example.sage, the program
will regenerate the three pdf files.)
