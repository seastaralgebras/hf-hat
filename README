**********************************
First of all, you need to install Sage. (Visit http://www.sagemath.org/)

The main program is hf-hat.sage. Some Heegaard diagrams are stored in
the file heegaard_diagrams.sage.  Some detailed examples are worked
out in example.sage. See the files for further instructions.

Add your Heegaard diagram to file heegaard_diagrams.sage. (Feel free
to comment out the older Heegaard diagrams.)

Start sage. (On the Bash terminal on my GNU+Linux system, typing sage
works.) Then load heegaard_diagrams.sage.
